                    <p>Everybody has that one book that would have triggered their interest in reading,and for me taht book is "A thousand splendid suns" by Khaled hosseini.</p>
                    <p>I have read collection of short stories for the most of my time,and my favourite among them being “grandma's bag of stories" by Sudha murty.She is a favourite author of mine for short stories.
                        But little did I know i would fall in love with a novel until I read “A Thousand splendid suns" by Khaled hosseini.It has been days I had finished reading the book ,but it has left a great impact on me and I just can't stop talking about this book.Khaled hosseini’s 
                        way of narration got my heart wrenched.I have not been a passionate reader but this book made me want to read more.</p>

                <div class="bookreview">
                    <p>Gone girl is the book that took me so long to read.</p>
                        <p>The first part of the book is kinda long and it took me 
                        a little more time to read it.I did not kinda like reading it at first as the storyline seemed to be very slow.But,yeah I was totally blown out 
                        as I started reading the second part.I started admiring the writing style of Gillian Flynn.I also re-read a few lines because of how much it made sense.
                        The plot of this book was just insane I would say.And eventually I fell in lobve with this book.</p>
                        <p>This book felt raw depicting the real world instances,talking about the personalities of people.
                            As a whole,I surely would recommend this book if u wanna kill time.

                <div class="bookreview">
                    <p>I was curious to read this book just because of it's title "A good girl's guide to murder".  </p>
                    <p>I was never disappointed while reading this book,Holly jackson has made sure to keep the readers at check with each of it's chapters.
                     And this is the book that I completed reading faster than any of my other books.
                     Holly Jackson had me guessing the murderer of Sal throughout the book and the chapter where the murderer was revealed was my favourite.I still remember how excited I was as I read that chapter.
                    </p>
                    <p>I would surely recommend this book if u are just starting to read and I am also curious to read the other two books of this series.

                    <p>I had heard enough about this book before I started reading it.I had already read a few books of the same author "Colleen Hoover",also known as coho.
                        But Verity is my personal favourite and yea I remain thankful to the friend who made me give coho a last try :)</p>
                        <p>Coho really surprised me with this book,This one was a unique one from her.The twists in this book are all worth it.There do exists a few loopholes,
                            but nevertheless I found it interesting enough for me to distract myself from a monotonous routine.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If asked to pick a favourite part from the book,I would definitely pick the ending.
                            Although Coho did leave the readers hanging by without giving it a perfect ending,It had me thinking about the book for atleast two days.</p>

                <div class="bookreview">
                    <p>I have been wanting to read this book for a very long time, and yea finally got to read it.All Thanks to the friend who lent me this book.I really did not have any expectation reading this book,I just was wanting a easy read as i have been reading the Kafka on the shore by Haruki Murakami, and this book was so worth it.</p>
                    <p>It was heart warming, emotional and i would not call it gripping, but the plot kept me in check until i completed it.I feel sorry for them, they could have been just perfect.But you know not every story has a happy ending and maybe thats why i loved this book even more just because there was no fantasising.And i then watched the movie.Reading the book and then getting to watch the movie was one kind of a experience.
                        </p><p>It was rollercoaster of emotions, and the last scene did make me cry :( </p>

                <div class="bookreview">
                    <p>Damn! I just finished reading this book after the much waited anticipation as I finished reading "A good girls guide to murder" and this book had my mind boggling.</p>
                    <p>I just love the Pip and Ravi combo and I would have to agree on that,I know I have not been a great fan of romance but I think it was because they all were nothing much but smut.But here I find myself enjoying and shipping pip and ravi</p>
                    <p>And I just realised how deep I can get when I start reading. As I keep completing reading each book I find something new ,something interesting ,or atleast I could say I find some comfort not living in the real world for atleast a mere moment. I am actually falling in love  with my books more than I planned to :) and I just dont regret it.</p>
